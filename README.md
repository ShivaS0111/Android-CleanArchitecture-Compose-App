# Android-CleanArchitecture-Compose-App(Movies App)

This repository is an Android application built using **Clean Architecture** principles, structured to promote scalability, testability, and separation of concerns. The application is divided into three main layers: `data`, `domain`, and `ui`, along with a `di` (Dependency Injection) module for managing dependencies.

## Project Structure

The project structure is designed to ensure each layer has a clear role:

- **domain**: Defines abstract implementations of core functionalities.
- **data**: Implements the `domain` layer interfaces and provides data management logic.
- **ui**: Contains all UI-related components, navigation, and screen-related ViewModels.
- **di**: Handles Dependency Injection to manage dependencies between layers.

---

### 1. `domain` Layer

The `domain` layer is the core of the application. It contains abstract implementations of the projectâ€™s core requirements and business logic. This layer has no dependency on Android frameworks, making it independent and easily testable.

#### Folders

- **common**
    - `Result`: A utility class for handling success and error states consistently throughout the app.
- **datasource**
    - **local**
        - **dao**: Defines the database access objects (DAO) required by the local data source.
            - `MovieDAO`: Interface for local database operations specific to movies.
        - **entities**: Contains the data entities representing the database tables.
            - `Movie`: Represents a movie entity in the local database.
        - **util**: Provides utilities and converters for the local database.
            - `RoomDataTypeConverters`: Custom type converters for the Room database.
        - `AppDatabase.kt`: Sets up the Room database for the application.
        - `MoviesLocalDataSource`: Abstract interface for local data access methods.
    - **network**
        - **datasource**
            - `BaseNetworkDatasource.kt`: Base class to handle common network-related functionalities.
            - `MoviesNetworkDataSource`: Abstract interface for fetching data from remote sources.
        - `ApiService`: Defines the API endpoints and related methods for network operations.
        - `MoviesDataSource`: General abstraction for data sources (both local and network).
- **model**
    - `ImageData`: Represents image data associated with movies.
- **repository**
    - `MoviesRepository`: Abstract interface that serves as the main contract for data access. It provides the necessary methods to retrieve movie data from different sources.

### 2. `data` Layer

The `data` layer contains implementations of the abstractions defined in the `domain` layer. It includes the logic for accessing local and remote data sources, as well as the repository implementation that the `ui` layer interacts with.

#### Folders

- **datasource**
    - **local**: Implements the local data source functionalities using Room and other local storage options.
        - `MoviesLocalDataSourceImpl`: Concrete implementation of `MoviesLocalDataSource`.
    - **network**
        - **apiclient**: Contains network client implementations.
            - `ApiServiceImpl`: Implementation of the `ApiService` interface for network operations.
            - `MoviesNetworkDataSourceImpl`: Concrete implementation of `MoviesNetworkDataSource`, fetching data from APIs.
- **repository**
    - `MoviesRepositoryImpl.kt`: Implements `MoviesRepository` interface and integrates data from both local and remote sources to provide a single source of truth.

---

### 3. `ui` Layer

The `ui` layer is responsible for the application's user interface, including all screen components, navigation logic, and UI-specific ViewModels. This layer interacts only with the `domain` layer, following the principle of dependency inversion.

#### Folders

- **components**: Reusable UI components shared across multiple screens.
    - `AppHeader.kt`: Component for displaying the app's header.
    - `LoaderComponent.kt`: Component for showing loading states.
    - `MovieItemComponent.kt`: Component to display individual movie items in a list.
- **navigation**
    - `HomeNavigation.kt`: Handles the navigation setup between different screens.
    - `Navigate`: Defines and manages navigation actions across the app.
- **screens**
    - **details**: Components and ViewModels for the movie details screen.
        - `MovieDetailsScreen.kt`: UI for displaying detailed movie information.
        - `MovieDetailsViewModel`: Manages UI-related data for the details screen.
    - **list**: Components and ViewModels for the movie list screen.
        - `MoveListScreen.kt`: UI for displaying a list of movies.
        - `MovieListViewModel`: Manages UI-related data for the list screen.
- **stateHolders**
    - `StateHolder`: Holds and manages UI state across multiple components.
- **theme**
    - `Color.kt`: Defines the color palette used in the app.
    - `Theme.kt`: Configures the app's theme settings.
    - `Type.kt`: Defines the typography styles.
    - `MoviesApp.kt`: Main entry point of the app, setting up the app's theme and initializing the navigation graph.

### 4. `di` (Dependency Injection) Module

The `di` module is a project-level folder that configures Dependency Injection using Dagger or Hilt (or another DI library). It provides a single source for initializing dependencies, enabling easy swapping of implementations and enhancing testability.

This module ensures that dependencies are injected into components across all layers, including `data`, `domain`, and `ui`, following the Clean Architecture guidelines.

---

## Project Principles

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a specific responsibility, isolating business logic, data management, and user interface concerns.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Higher-level modules (`ui` layer) depend on abstractions defined in the `domain` layer, not on lower-level modules.
- **Single Source of Truth**: The `repository` in the `data` layer consolidates data from local and network sources, providing a unified data source for the app.
